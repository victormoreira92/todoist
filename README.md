üöÄ Installation
1. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/username/todoist.git
cd todoist


Replace https://github.com/username/todoist.git with the actual repository URL.

2. Set Up the Backend
Navigate to the backend directory:
cd backend-todoist

Install Dependencies
bundle install

Configure PostgreSQL
Ensure PostgreSQL is running. Create a database user if needed:
psql -U postgres
CREATE ROLE todoist_user WITH LOGIN PASSWORD 'your_password';
ALTER ROLE todoist_user CREATEDB;
\q

Update config/database.yml with your credentials:
default: &default
  adapter: postgresql
  encoding: unicode
  pool: <%= ENV.fetch("RAILS_MAX_THREADS") { 5 } %>
  username: todoist_user
